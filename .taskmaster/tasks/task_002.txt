# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Deploy PostgreSQL Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and deploy the PostgreSQL database schema using Supabase, including tables for events, contacts, lead_groups, email_campaigns, and activity_logs.
# Details:
Use Drizzle ORM to define schema models in TypeScript. Create migrations for events, contacts, lead_groups, email_campaigns, and activity_logs tables. Deploy schema to Supabase. Ensure foreign keys and constraints match the logical dependency chain (e.g., contacts reference events).

# Test Strategy:
Validate schema with integration tests, checking CRUD operations for each table. Confirm relationships and constraints are enforced.
